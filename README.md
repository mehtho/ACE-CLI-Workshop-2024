# ACE CLI Workshop 2024
Welcome to the ACE CLI Workshop 2024 Exercises repository! 

This repository contains hands-on exercises and examples for the ACE Command Line Interface (CLI) Workshop 2024. These CLI skills will help students upgrade their work habits to maximise efficiency and confidently face challenging situations without GUIs. 

This workshop was intended to be an introduction to CLIs for students that had never touched a CLI before, hence the extreme simplicity and comfortable pace. It was run in accordance with our philosophy of raising the skill floor of the SCIS student population. This workshop was meant to impart essential basic skills with an accomodating, human touch as opposed to conventional video lectures and writeups. 

Many thanks to the other organizers, instructors and participants!
